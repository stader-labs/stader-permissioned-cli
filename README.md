### Stader Permissioned Node and EthX

ETHx is an innovative liquid staking token developed by Stader, designed to revolutionize Ethereum staking. Our vision for ETHx is to transform the staking experience, providing users with the unprecedented freedom to move and utilize their staked ETH while continuing to earn rewards and engage with the growing DeFi ecosystem.

The EthX permissioned pool will onboard a few select operators with a history of running nodes at no collateral. This serves as backup capacity and for scalability. To be a part of the permissioned pool, Potential NOs have to show qualifications of prior expertise in running Ethereum nodes and pass KYC checks subject to Stader DAO approval. These operators can run validators without needing a security bond. Qualifying for this criterion and a DAO approval enables the node operator to join ETHxâ€™s permissioned pool.

This repo contains code for the stader-permissioned-cli which allows NOs to easily join EthX permissioned pool and become a crucial part in Stader's missions to revolutionize Ethereum Staking!
